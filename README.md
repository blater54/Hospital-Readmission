## Summary

Hospital Readmission is a big issue within the industry. As someone who wants to become a Data Scientist in Health, I wanted to contribute to its cause. The data obtained was from medicare.gov and it features 19,344 data. The objective of this project was to compare Medicare's predictive data with my own prediction.
